-- Performance Analysis Summary:
-- Before Indexing:
-- - The test query likely uses a sequential scan on the reviews table for the subquery, as no index exists on reviews.property_id.
-- - The outer query may use an index scan on properties.property_id (if itâ€™s a primary key index) but still requires scanning the entire properties table to match the subquery results.
-- - Execution time is higher, especially for large datasets, due to the sequential scan on reviews.
--
-- After Indexing:
-- - The index idx_reviews_property_id enables an index scan for the subquery, reducing the cost of grouping and filtering by r.property_id.
-- - The outer query continues to leverage the primary key index on properties.property_id (idx_properties_property_id).
-- - Execution time is reduced, particularly for large datasets, as the index scan on reviews.property_id avoids scanning all rows.
-- - Note: Actual performance improvements depend on data size. For small datasets (e.g., seed.sql), the difference may be minimal, but for thousands of rows, the index significantly lowers execution time.
